# Personality-Prediction-mini

In this project, I try to optimize a supervised machine learning algorithm to predict Myers-Briggs personality profiles of Kaggle forum users based on the MBTI (Myers-Briggs Personality Type) Dataset on Kaggle.

The Myers Briggs Type Indicator (or MBTI for short) is a personality type system that divides everyone into 16 distinct personality types across 4 axis:

1) Introversion (I) – Extroversion (E) : a measure of how much an individual prefers their outer or inner world.

2) Intuition (N) – Sensing (S) : a measure of how much an individual processes information through the five senses versus impressions through patterns

3) Thinking (T) – Feeling (F) : a measure of preference for objective principles and facts versus weighing the emotional perspectives of others.

4) Judging (J) – Perceiving (P) : a measure of how much an individual prefers a planned and ordered life versus a flexible and spontaneous life.
