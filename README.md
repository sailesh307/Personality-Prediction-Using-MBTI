### Personality Prediction Project
#### 1.Introduction

  In this project, I try to optimize a supervised machine learning algorithm to predict Myers-Briggs personality profiles of Kaggle forum users based on the MBTI (Myers-Briggs Personality Type) Dataset on Kaggle.

  Dataset link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasnaek/mbti-type
  
  The Myers Briggs Type Indicator (or MBTI for short) is a personality type system that divides everyone into 16 distinct personality types across 4 axis:
  
    1) Introversion (I) – Extroversion (E)
    2) Intuition (N) – Sensing (S)
    3) Thinking (T) – Feeling (F)
    4) Judging (J) – Perceiving (P)
